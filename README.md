# Todo
- [ ] Write tests with Rake.
- [ ] Also test using Rake.
- [x] Add camping as a development dependency.
- [x] Add a Gemfile.
- [ ] Test the gem with a greenfield project.
- [ ] Write some guides on how to use Active Record.
- [x] Get default database locations and config.kdl stuff working too.
- [x] Enter the thing into Git.
- [ ] Write a Readme.
- [ ] Finish work on Camping 3.0 so that this gem can be used like legit.
- [ ] Map migration commands to Rake automatically somehow.
- [ ] Map Generators to rake somehow too.
- [x] Have a default spot that settings are grabbed from. (/db/config.kdl)
- [x] Have a setting where a database connection string is grabbed by default
- [ ] Test that settings added using #set on the Camping app take precedence.
- [ ] Add an example Camping App using the Extension.
- [ ] Generate config.yml for the rake tasks stuff thing. It expects it.

# Notes:
It would be cool If we could map Active Record generators to rake tasks automatically from Plugins.

Camping needs a place to mount Command line arguments automagically. migrations is something that needs to be universal and good and stuff.
